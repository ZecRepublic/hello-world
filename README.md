# hello-world
My first repository as an intro to Git


Hello, my name is Zachary. 

I have experience in html, css, and javascript, 
and I'm now seeking to expand my skillset and get a job as a front-end developer.
Currently, I'm gaining experience using React and jQuery, 
and now I'm adding Git and Github to the list.

I've always had a knack and a passion for puzzles and problem-solving.
I love using parts and components to build something new, 
and I enjoy facing issues head-on and finding solutions.
